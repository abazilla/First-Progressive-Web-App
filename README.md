After learning more about Progressive Web Apps at the Sydney Progressive App meetup, I decided to create my first progressive web app, using google's tutorial. What I will learn as part of this tutorial is:

* How to design and construct an app using the “app shell” method
* How to make your app work offline
* How to store data for use offline later
